Why use Random Forest?
One of the benefits of using a random forest is that it is relatively robust to overfitting, meaning that it will still make good predictions even if you have a lot of data. This is because the individual decision trees in the forest are able to cancel out some of the noise in the data.
Another benefit of using a random forest is that it is relatively easy to interpret. This is because each decision tree can be looked at individually and the interactions between them can be visualized using a graph called a “forest plot”.

Application:
Real-world applications where random forest could be useful include:
Predicting the quality of wines
Classifying galaxies
Determining if someone is likely to develop diabetes in the future
